## 2025-07-29: Claude Code Hooks for Workflow Enforcement

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team, Agent OS Users
**Related Spec:** @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-claude-code-hooks-#37/

### Decision

Implement Claude Code hooks system to solve the critical workflow abandonment problem by enforcing workflow completion, auto-committing documentation changes, and injecting contextual information automatically.

### Context

User feedback and GitHub issues (#36, #37) revealed that users frequently abandon Agent OS workflows after receiving quality check summaries, leaving work in incomplete states (unmerged PRs, unclosed issues, dirty workspaces). This undermines Agent OS's core mission of providing reliable, structured AI-assisted development.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Process Improvements**
   - Pros: No technical implementation required, immediate deployment
   - Cons: Relies on user discipline, doesn't solve fundamental abandonment issue

   - Cons: Dependency on Anthropic roadmap, requires extension expertise

### Rationale

Claude Code hooks provide the perfect balance of automation and user control. They operate transparently during normal AI interactions while enforcing Agent OS workflow integrity. The three-hook approach (stop, postToolUse, userPromptSubmit) addresses all identified abandonment patterns while maintaining Agent OS's shell script architecture.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Eliminates workflow abandonment problem through automatic enforcement
- Improves AI assistance quality through contextual information injection
- Maintains documentation consistency with automatic commits
- Preserves Agent OS's tool-agnostic philosophy while providing deep Claude Code integration

## 2025-07-30: Critical Quality Enforcement Requirements

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** All Agent OS Users, Development Team
**Related Issues:** #6, #7, #8, #9

### Decision

Implement mandatory verification and testing requirements before any work can be marked as complete. Claude must prove functionality works through actual testing, not just assume success after implementation.

### Context

Users are discovering that Claude consistently marks work as "complete" without testing it, leading to:
- Broken scripts marked as "working"
- Non-functional authentication marked as "âœ“ COMPLETE"
- Tests written but never run
- Features claimed as done that fail on first use

User feedback: "you are not really doing the work that you say you are doing"

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Trust-based approach (current)**
   - Pros: Faster apparent progress
   - Cons: Broken features, eroded trust, constant rework

2. **Manual verification reminders**
   - Pros: Simple to implement
   - Cons: Claude often ignores reminders, not enforceable

3. **Automated verification enforcement**
   - Pros: Guaranteed quality, restored trust, actually working features
   - Cons: Slower initial progress, requires workflow updates

The current approach has failed catastrophically. Multiple examples show Claude claiming victory without verification, leading to user frustration and wasted time. Mandatory verification is the only way to restore trust and ensure Agent OS delivers on its promise of reliable AI-assisted development.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Features actually work when delivered
- User trust in Agent OS restored
- Reduced rework and debugging time
- Higher quality output
- Clear audit trail of verification

**Negative:**
- Slower perceived progress (but faster real progress)
- More complex workflow enforcement needed
- Additional hooks and checks required

## 2025-07-30: Project Configuration Memory System

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Agent OS Users, Claude Code Users, Development Team
**Related Spec:** @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-project-config-amnesia-#12/

### Decision

Implement comprehensive project configuration memory system to eliminate Claude Code's amnesia about project-specific settings (ports, package managers, startup commands) through enhanced context loading, session persistence, and hook integration.

### Context

Critical Issue #12 reports that Claude Code consistently forgets project configuration and reverts to defaults, causing:
- Port configuration amnesia (uses 3000/8000 instead of configured ports)
- Package manager switches (reverts from uv to pip, creates unnecessary virtual environments)
- Startup command amnesia (ignores start.sh scripts, uses different commands)
- Tech stack forgetfulness (ignores documented choices in tech-stack.md)

This directly contradicts Agent OS's mission to provide "first-try success" and "consistent, high-quality output."

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Configuration Reminders**
   - Pros: Simple to implement, no architectural changes
   - Cons: Claude ignores reminders, requires constant user intervention

2. **Environment Variable Only Approach**
   - Pros: Universal compatibility, simple implementation
   - Cons: Limited to environment variables, doesn't solve startup command issues

3. **Comprehensive Configuration Memory System** (Selected)
   - Pros: Addresses all amnesia sources, persistent across sessions, hook-integrated
   - Cons: Complex implementation, requires multiple components

### Rationale

The configuration amnesia problem directly undermines Agent OS's core value proposition. A comprehensive solution is necessary because partial fixes don't address the scope of the problem. The selected approach leverages existing hook infrastructure while remaining tool-agnostic for future expansion.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Eliminates Claude Code's configuration amnesia completely
- Provides consistent AI behavior that respects project patterns
- Enhances user experience through reliable first-try success
- Strengthens Agent OS's reliability and trust factor
- Creates foundation for advanced project context awareness

**Negative:**
- Adds complexity to Agent OS architecture
- Requires coordination between multiple components
- Initial implementation effort is substantial
- May impact performance if not optimized properly
