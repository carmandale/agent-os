## Purpose

This research informs Agent OS's development of intelligent workflow enforcement that distinguishes active maintenance work from new feature development, providing context-aware commit reminders without disrupting developer flow.

## Key Findings

### 1. Context Awareness is Critical

**Industry Data:**
- 65% of developers report AI tools "miss relevant context" as primary frustration
- #1 requested improvement: "better contextual understanding" (26% of all votes)
- Hallucinations and quality issues often stem from poor context awareness

**Implication for Agent OS:** Time-based heuristics alone create false positives. Must combine multiple context signals.

### 2. Developer Flow State is Fragile

**Research Findings:**
- Interruption recovery time: 20-60 minutes
- Developers get only ONE 2-hour uninterrupted session per day
- Self-interruptions (like commit reminders) are MORE disruptive than external ones

**Implication for Agent OS:** Trigger reminders only at natural breakpoints (end of session, branch switch), never during active editing.

### 3. Time-Based Heuristics Standards

**Industry Benchmarks:**

| Use Case | Threshold | Authority |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Idle detection (low-risk) | 15-30 minutes | OWASP |
| Idle detection (high-value) | 2-5 minutes | OWASP |
| Active work indicator | <30 minutes since activity | Development tools |
| Stale work flag | >24 hours since last commit | Git conventions |
| Abandoned work flag | >7 days since last commit | GitHub patterns |

**Implication for Agent OS:** Use 30-minute threshold for detecting "no recent activity", then examine context before taking action.

### 4. Git Porcelain Format is Essential

**Why:**
- Guaranteed stable across Git versions
- Unaffected by user configuration
- Designed specifically for script parsing

**Commands:**
```bash
git status --porcelain              # Detect changes
git status --porcelain=v2 --branch  # Include branch info
git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate  # Branch activity
```

**Implication for Agent OS:** Never parse human-readable git output; always use porcelain format.

### 5. Hooks Must Be Fast and Clear

**Industry Standards:**
- Target: <100ms for context extraction
- Maximum: 10 seconds for any hook
- Requirement: Clear, actionable error messages

**Anti-Pattern:** Slow or opaque hooks get bypassed with `--no-verify`

**Implication for Agent OS:** Cache context (5-minute TTL), provide explicit next steps in all messages.

## Recommended Architecture

### Hybrid Time + Context Detection

```
Step 1: Fast Time Check (5ms)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> If last activity < 30 min ‚Üí SKIP (active work)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> If last activity > 30 min ‚Üí CONTINUE

Step 2: Context Analysis (cached, 50-100ms)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Git status (dirty/clean)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Branch info (name, last commit)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> PR status (open/draft/merged)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Issue references

Step 3: Decision Logic
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Dirty + active PR = ACTIVE (no action)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Clean + old commits = IDLE (gentle reminder)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Dirty + old commits = STALE (stronger reminder)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Merged PR + dirty = CLEANUP REQUIRED (block new work)
```

### Progressive Reminder Strategy

| Level | Trigger | Action | Tone |
|-------|---------|--------|------|
| **Nudge** | 2 hours uncommitted | Gentle suggestion | Informational |
| **Reminder** | 4 hours uncommitted | Explicit reminder | Encouraging |
| **Warning** | 24 hours uncommitted | Strong recommendation | Urgent |
| **Block** | New work without cleanup | Prevent action | Mandatory |

### Context Indicators

**High-Confidence Active Work:**
1. Uncommitted changes present (dirty workspace)
2. Recent commits (<4 hours ago)
3. Open draft PR on current branch
4. Recent file modifications (<2 hours)
5. Linked active issue

**High-Confidence Abandoned Work:**
1. Clean workspace + no commits in 7+ days
2. Merged PR but still on feature branch
3. Closed issue with uncommitted changes
4. No activity in past week

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Context Extraction Performance

**Target Benchmarks:**

| Operation | Target | Maximum |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Check dirty status | <5ms | 10ms |
| Get branch name | <5ms | 10ms |
| Get last commit date | <10ms | 25ms |
| Check PR status | <50ms | 100ms |
| **Total context** | **<100ms** | **200ms** |

**Cache Strategy:**
- TTL: 5 minutes
- Invalidate on: commit, branch switch, file changes
- Storage: `/tmp/agent-os-context-$UID.json`

### 2. Stop-Hook Context Logic

```bash
IF uncommitted_changes THEN
  IF last_commit < 2_hours THEN
    ‚Üí "üí° Consider committing recent work"
  ELSIF last_commit < 24_hours THEN
    ‚Üí "üìã Uncommitted work from today - please commit"
  ELSE
    ‚Üí "‚ö†Ô∏è STALE: Commit or stash before losing context"
  ENDIF
ELSIF open_pr THEN
  ‚Üí "‚úÖ Clean workspace. Review and merge PR"
ELSIF active_issue THEN
  ‚Üí "üìå Working on issue - ready for next session"
ELSE
  ‚Üí "‚úÖ Clean workspace. No active work."
ENDIF
```

### 3. Pre-Task Validation

**Before starting new feature work:**

1. Check for uncommitted changes ‚Üí BLOCK if present
2. Check for open PR on current branch ‚Üí WARN, allow override
3. Verify clean workspace ‚Üí BLOCK if dirty
4. Create GitHub issue ‚Üí BLOCK if missing

**Philosophy:** Block when starting NEW work, allow flexibility during MAINTENANCE.

### 4. Message Templates

**Good Message Structure:**
```
[Icon] [Clear statement of situation]

[Context: What was detected]

[Action Required/Recommended:]
  ‚Ä¢ Specific command to run
  ‚Ä¢ What it does
  ‚Ä¢ Expected outcome

[Optional: Why this matters]
```

**Example:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Uncommitted changes detected from 2 days ago

Context:
  ‚Ä¢ 12 modified files on feature/user-auth branch
  ‚Ä¢ Last commit: 2025-10-13 (48 hours ago)
  ‚Ä¢ Related to issue #123

Action Required:
  1. Review changes: git status
  2. Commit work: git add . && git commit -m "feat: auth middleware #123"
  3. OR stash for later: git stash save "WIP: auth middleware"

Why: Uncommitted work risks being lost or forgotten between sessions.
```

## Shell Script Patterns

### Detect Dirty Workspace

```bash
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  echo "dirty"
else
  echo "clean"
fi
```

### Get Hours Since Last Commit

```bash
last_commit=$(git log -1 --format=%ct 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
now=$(date +%s)
hours=$(( ($now - $last_commit) / 3600 ))
echo "$hours"
```

### Get Current Branch

```bash
# Most reliable for scripts
branch=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "detached")
```

### List Branches by Activity

```bash
git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate \
  --format='%(committerdate:relative) %(refname:short)' \
  refs/heads/
```

### Check for Open PR

```bash
current_branch=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)
pr_json=$(gh pr list --head "$current_branch" --json number,state 2>/dev/null)

if [ -n "$pr_json" ]; then
  pr_number=$(echo "$pr_json" | jq -r '.[0].number')
  echo "PR #$pr_number exists"
fi
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Interrupting active flow** - Only remind at natural breakpoints
2. ‚ùå **Slow hooks** - Must be <100ms to avoid frustration
3. ‚ùå **Opaque failures** - Always explain what, why, how to fix
4. ‚ùå **Rigid time boundaries** - Use context to refine decisions
5. ‚ùå **Blocking maintenance** - Only block NEW feature work, not fixes
6. ‚ùå **Uncached context** - Cache for 5 minutes to avoid overhead
7. ‚ùå **False positives** - Combine multiple signals before flagging
8. ‚ùå **Non-bypassable enforcement** - Soft locally, hard in CI

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets

- Context extraction <100ms (p95)
- <5% false positives (flagged as abandoned when active)
- <2% false negatives (missed abandoned work)
- Hook bypass rate <10% (indicates user trust)

### Qualitative Goals

- User feedback: "Helpful, not hindering"
- Messages are "clear and actionable"
- Increased commit frequency (better hygiene)
- Reduced PR cleanup time

## Next Steps

1. **Review** with development team
2. **Prioritize** recommendations for implementation
3. **Create** detailed technical spec
4. **Implement** in phases:
   - Phase 1: Foundation (context extraction, caching)
   - Phase 2: Decision logic (progressive reminders)
   - Phase 3: Hook integration (stop-hook, pre-task)
   - Phase 4: Optimization (performance, caching)
   - Phase 5: Polish (UX refinement, documentation)

## Conclusion

Context-aware workflow enforcement requires **hybrid time + context detection** with **progressive escalation** and **fast, cached context extraction**. The key is balancing automation (preventing bad states) with flexibility (allowing legitimate maintenance work) while respecting developer flow state.

**Core Principle:** Use time thresholds for initial detection, then examine context to make intelligent decisions about when to remind, warn, or block. Always provide clear, actionable guidance.
