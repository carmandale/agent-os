# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-task-status-sync-#6/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-29
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality

- **Task-Commit Association**: Parse commit messages to identify which tasks are being worked on
- **File-Task Mapping**: Detect which files relate to which tasks based on task descriptions
- **Status Update Logic**: Automatically mark tasks complete based on implementation evidence
- **Validation Engine**: Compare task claims against actual filesystem/git state
- **Rollback Protection**: Prevent marking tasks complete if tests fail or build breaks

### Integration Points

- **Git Hooks**: Integrate with post-commit hooks for immediate updates
- **Claude Code Hooks**: Enhance existing hooks to include task synchronization
- **GitHub Integration**: Sync task status with issue/PR status
- **Test Framework**: Update tasks based on test execution results

### Performance Requirements

- Task detection must complete in <100ms to avoid workflow delays
- Validation checks should run asynchronously where possible
- Batch updates to minimize file I/O operations

## Approach Options

**Option A: Git Hook Based**
- Pros: Immediate updates, works with any git operation, reliable
- Cons: Requires git hook installation, may miss non-git updates

**Option B: Claude Code Hook Based** (Selected)
- Pros: Integrated with existing Agent OS hooks, can validate before updates, context aware
- Cons: Only works with Claude Code, requires hook installation

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Pros: Maximum coverage, fallback mechanisms
- Cons: Complex implementation, potential conflicts

**Rationale:** Claude Code hooks provide the best integration with existing Agent OS infrastructure and can leverage context awareness for intelligent task matching.

## External Dependencies

- **No new dependencies required** - Utilizes existing Agent OS hook infrastructure
- Leverages existing git and GitHub CLI tools already required by Agent OS

## Implementation Architecture

### Task Detection System

```bash
# Pattern matching for task references in commits
# Format: "task 1.2" or "#1.2" or "completes 1.2"
TASK_PATTERN='(task|completes?|implements?|fixes?|closes?)\s*#?\s*([0-9]+\.?[0-9]*)'

# File-to-task mapping based on task descriptions
# Example: "Create workflow-detector.sh" â†’ detects creation of that file
```

### Validation Rules

1. **File Creation Tasks**: Verify file exists at expected path
2. **Test Tasks**: Verify test files exist and related tests pass
3. **Implementation Tasks**: Verify code changes in relevant files
4. **Documentation Tasks**: Verify markdown files updated

### Update Strategies

1. **Conservative Mode**: Only update if 100% confident in match
2. **Interactive Mode**: Ask user to confirm task completions
3. **Aggressive Mode**: Update based on probable matches

### Integration Flow

1. **Post-Tool-Use Hook** triggers after file modifications
2. **Task Matcher** identifies potentially completed tasks
3. **Validator** confirms task requirements are met
4. **Updater** modifies tasks.md with new status
5. **Committer** creates atomic commit for task updates
