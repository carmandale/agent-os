# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-task-status-sync-#6/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-29
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Task Detection Module**
- Test pattern matching for various task reference formats
- Test file-to-task description matching logic
- Test task ID parsing and validation
- Test handling of malformed task references

**Validation Module**
- Test file existence validation for creation tasks
- Test code change detection for implementation tasks
- Test documentation update detection
- Test false positive prevention

**Update Module**
- Test tasks.md parsing and modification
- Test checkbox state changes
- Test preservation of task descriptions
- Test handling of nested subtasks

### Integration Tests

**Git Integration**
- Test task updates triggered by commits
- Test rollback on commit failures
- Test multi-file commits affecting multiple tasks
- Test merge commit handling

**Hook Integration**
- Test integration with existing Claude Code hooks
- Test performance impact on hook execution
- Test error handling without blocking workflow
- Test cleanup on hook failures

**Workflow Integration**
- Test full execute-tasks workflow with auto-updates
- Test validation preventing premature task completion
- Test interaction with manual task updates
- Test conflict resolution

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Scenarios**
- Developer implements feature and commits → tasks auto-update
- Tests fail after implementation → tasks remain incomplete
- Multiple commits complete single task → appropriate update
- Task manually marked complete → validation confirms or reverts

**Edge Cases**
- Spec with 100+ tasks performance testing
- Corrupted tasks.md recovery
- Simultaneous updates from multiple sources
- Network failures during GitHub sync

### Mocking Requirements

- **Git Operations**: Mock git commands for unit tests
- **File System**: Mock file operations for isolated testing
- **GitHub API**: Mock API responses for integration tests
- **Time-based Tests**: Mock system time for update timing

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Test-First Development
1. Write failing tests for task detection patterns
2. Write failing tests for validation rules
3. Write failing tests for update logic
4. Implement minimal code to pass each test
5. Add integration tests for complete workflows

### Continuous Validation
- Run tests on every hook execution
- Validate task status after every update
- Self-test during Agent OS health checks

### Performance Benchmarks
- Task detection: <50ms for 95th percentile
- Full validation: <200ms for typical spec
- Update operation: <100ms including file write
