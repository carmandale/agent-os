# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Task Status Synchronization
> Created: 2025-07-29
> GitHub Issue: #6
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement automatic task status synchronization to ensure tasks.md accurately reflects actual implementation state, preventing the gap between completed work and task tracking that undermines Agent OS reliability.

## User Stories

### Broken Trust Recovery

As a developer using Agent OS, I want task status to automatically update when work is completed, so that I can trust tasks.md as the single source of truth for project progress.

Currently, developers discover that tasks show as incomplete even after full implementation, creating confusion and requiring manual reconciliation. This breaks the fundamental promise of Agent OS - reliable, structured development workflows.

### Seamless Workflow Integration  

As an AI assistant following Agent OS workflows, I want automatic task updates integrated into my normal workflow, so that task tracking happens without additional steps or cognitive load.

The synchronization should be invisible during normal development - when I commit code that completes a task, the task should automatically be marked complete. When I run tests that pass, test tasks should update. This maintains workflow fluency while ensuring accuracy.

## Spec Scope

1. **Automatic Task Detection** - Identify when implementation work relates to specific tasks
2. **Git Integration** - Update task status based on commit messages and file changes
3. **Validation System** - Compare task claims against actual codebase state
4. **Hook Enhancement** - Extend existing hooks to handle task synchronization
5. **Workflow Integration** - Seamlessly integrate into execute-tasks workflow

## Out of Scope

- Retroactive task status updates for historical specs
- Task status synchronization across multiple repositories
- Complex task dependency management
- Task time tracking or estimation features

## Expected Deliverable

1. Tasks automatically marked complete when implementation is committed
2. Validation prevents false completion claims and status mismatches
3. Zero manual task status updates required during normal workflow

## Critical Importance

This feature addresses a **fundamental trust issue** in Agent OS. Without reliable task synchronization:
- Developers lose faith in the framework's promises
- Manual reconciliation defeats the purpose of automation  
- The gap between reality and tracking undermines all workflows
- Team collaboration becomes impossible with unreliable status

**This is not an enhancement - it's a critical bug fix for Agent OS credibility.**
