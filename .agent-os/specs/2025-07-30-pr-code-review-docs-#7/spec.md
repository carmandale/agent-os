# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: PR Code Review Documentation Enhancement
> Created: 2025-07-30
> GitHub Issue: #7
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance pull request creation with comprehensive code review documentation to build trust in PRs by providing clear summaries of changes, testing evidence, and implementation details that make code review efficient and thorough.

**CLAUDE CODE INTEGRATION NOTE**: This solution integrates with the completed Claude Code hooks system (Issue #37). PR creation enhancement will operate through the git workflow in step 4 of task execution, automatically generating comprehensive PR descriptions when commits are made through Agent OS workflows.

## User Stories

### Trustworthy PR Creation

As a developer using Agent OS, I want PRs to automatically include comprehensive documentation of what was changed, why it was changed, and evidence that it works, so that code reviewers can quickly understand and approve changes with confidence.

**Current Problem:** PRs created by Claude often lack sufficient context:
- Missing description of implementation approach
- No evidence of testing or validation
- Unclear relationship to original requirements
- No summary of files changed and why

**Expected Workflow:** When Agent OS creates a PR, it should include detailed change summary, testing evidence, requirement traceability, and clear review guidance.

### Code Review Efficiency

As a code reviewer, I want PR descriptions to provide all context needed for efficient review, so that I can understand changes quickly without extensive investigation.

**Review Context Needed:**
- Summary of what problem was solved
- List of files changed with purpose of each change
- Evidence that features work (test output, screenshots)
- Any breaking changes or migration requirements

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhanced PR Description Generation** - Automatically create comprehensive PR descriptions with change summaries
2. **Testing Evidence Integration** - Include test output, validation proof, and functionality evidence in PR descriptions
3. **Requirement Traceability** - Link PR changes back to original spec requirements and tasks
4. **Code Review Guidance** - Provide specific guidance for reviewers on what to focus on
5. **Template System** - Standardized PR description templates for different types of changes

## Out of Scope

- Manual PR creation workflows outside Agent OS
- Integration with non-GitHub platforms
- Custom PR templates for specific repositories
- Automated code analysis tools integration

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Comprehensive PR descriptions automatically generated** - Every Agent OS PR includes change summary, testing evidence, and review guidance
2. **Testing evidence included in PR descriptions** - Test output, validation proof, and functionality verification documented
3. **Clear requirement traceability** - PR descriptions link changes back to original spec tasks and requirements
