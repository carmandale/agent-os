> Spec: Fix aos installer hooks configuration
> Created: 2025-08-30
> Status: Planning
> GitHub Issue: #91

## Overview

Fix the aos installer to properly configure Claude Code hooks during Agent OS installation. Currently, the installer fails to set up hooks correctly, preventing workflow enforcement and automatic Agent OS context injection from functioning.

## User Stories

**As an Agent OS user installing the system**
- I want the installation to automatically configure Claude Code hooks
- So that workflow enforcement and context injection work immediately after installation
- Without requiring manual hook configuration steps

**As a developer using Agent OS workflows**
- I want hooks to be automatically available after running setup scripts
- So that I get consistent workflow enforcement and AI assistance
- Without debugging hook configuration issues

**As a system administrator deploying Agent OS**
- I want the installation process to be reliable and complete
- So that users don't experience missing functionality
- Without requiring post-installation troubleshooting

## Spec Scope

**In Scope:**
- Fix hook installation and configuration in setup scripts
- Ensure hooks are properly registered with Claude Code
- Verify hook functionality during installation
- Update installation documentation for hook requirements
- Test hook configuration across different environments

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Modify setup.sh and setup-claude-code.sh to properly install hooks
- Ensure hook scripts are executable and in correct locations
- Verify Claude Code recognizes and loads hooks
- Add validation steps to check hook functionality
- Update health check scripts to include hook verification

## Out of Scope

- Creating new hook functionality (hooks already exist)
- Modifying existing hook behavior or logic
- Adding new hook types or capabilities
- Changing hook architecture or design
- Supporting other AI tools beyond Claude Code

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional aos installation process that:
1. Correctly installs and configures all Claude Code hooks
2. Validates hook installation during setup
3. Provides clear error messages if hook setup fails
4. Updates health check system to verify hook functionality
5. Includes updated documentation for hook requirements
