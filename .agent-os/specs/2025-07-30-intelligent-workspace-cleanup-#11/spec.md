# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Intelligent Workspace Cleanup
> Created: 2025-07-30
> GitHub Issue: #11
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement intelligent workspace cleanup to replace the current "commit everything" approach with smart analysis that distinguishes between valuable changes and temporary files, preventing over-committing while maintaining workflow enforcement.

**CLAUDE CODE INTEGRATION NOTE**: This solution modifies the completed Claude Code hooks system (Issue #37). Specifically, it enhances the `workflow-enforcement-hook-v2.py` to use intelligent analysis instead of blind commits. The hook infrastructure is complete and operational - this spec adds smart workspace analysis to the existing enforcement mechanism.

## User Stories

### Smart Workspace Analysis

As a developer using Agent OS with Claude Code hooks, I want the system to intelligently analyze my workspace changes so that only meaningful work gets committed while temporary files are safely cleaned up.

**Detailed Workflow:** When Claude encounters a dirty workspace, instead of committing everything indiscriminately, the system should analyze each changed file, categorize it as valuable work vs temporary/sensitive content, and provide appropriate cleanup actions (commit valuable changes, gitignore patterns for temp files, manual review for sensitive data, deletion for true temporary files).

### Security Protection

As a developer, I want the workspace cleanup system to detect and prevent commits of sensitive data (API keys, secrets, credentials) so that I never accidentally expose confidential information.

**Detailed Workflow:** The system should scan uncommitted changes for common secret patterns (API_KEY=, password=, token=, etc.), flag potential secrets for manual review, and block automatic commits when sensitive data is detected.

### Professional Git Hygiene

As a development team member, I want Agent OS to maintain clean, professional git history by only committing intentional changes so that our repository stays organized and reviewable.

**Detailed Workflow:** The cleanup system should distinguish between development artifacts (logs, builds, temp files) and actual code changes, automatically handle common temporary file patterns through gitignore updates, and ensure commits only contain purposeful modifications.

## Spec Scope

1. **Intelligent File Analysis** - Categorize workspace changes into valuable vs temporary vs sensitive content
2. **Smart Cleanup Actions** - Provide appropriate handling for each file category (commit, ignore, delete, manual review)
3. **Security Pattern Detection** - Identify and prevent commits of sensitive data like API keys and secrets
4. **Gitignore Management** - Automatically update .gitignore for common temporary file patterns
5. **Hook Integration** - Replace current blind commit behavior with intelligent cleanup workflow

## Out of Scope

- Complex machine learning for file classification (use rule-based approach)
- Integration with external security scanning tools
- Backup/recovery of accidentally deleted files
- Advanced conflict resolution beyond basic file categorization

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Workspace analyzer that correctly categorizes files** - System can distinguish between code changes, temporary files, and sensitive data
2. **Smart cleanup workflow** - Instead of committing everything, provides appropriate cleanup actions for each file type
3. **Security protection in action** - Blocks commits containing detected secrets and guides user through safe resolution
