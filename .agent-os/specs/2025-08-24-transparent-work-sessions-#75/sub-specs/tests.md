## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Work Session Manager Script**
- Test session creation with valid description
- Test session status reporting
- Test commit creation with proper message formatting
- Test session end with cleanup verification
- Test session abort with state removal

**Workflow Enforcement Hook**
- Test session state detection (environment variable and file)
- Test bypass logic when session active
- Test blocking behavior when session inactive
- Test error handling for corrupted session files

**Session State Management**
- Test file-based session tracking
- Test environment variable coordination
- Test concurrent session handling
- Test cleanup on failure scenarios

### Integration Tests

**Execute-tasks Workflow**
- Test auto-start detection with proper conditions (clean git + spec + issue)
- Test helpful blocking with improper conditions
- Test session lifecycle through complete workflow
- Test commit boundaries at natural workflow points
- Test override mechanism functionality

**Hook System Integration**
- Test pretool hook respects session state
- Test posttool hook handles session commits
- Test hook coordination during Task tool usage
- Test fallback behavior on hook failures

**Command Integration**
- Test /execute-tasks command path resolution
- Test instruction file loading and execution
- Test subagent delegation during sessions
- Test error propagation and recovery

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Transparent Operation**
- Complete /execute-tasks workflow with proper setup should produce 2-4 logical commits
- Complete /execute-tasks workflow with improper setup should provide helpful guidance
- Manual work session usage should continue to work as before
- Mixed workflow scenarios (switching between manual and auto sessions)

**Edge Case Scenarios**
- Claude Code restart during active session
- Git conflicts during session commits
- Network failures during GitHub operations
- Malformed spec or issue data
- Concurrent Agent OS operations

### Mocking Requirements

**External Services**
- **GitHub CLI (gh):** Mock issue validation and PR operations
- **Git Operations:** Mock git status, commit, and branch operations for testing
- **File System:** Mock session file creation and cleanup for unit tests

**Time-based Tests**
- **Session Duration:** Mock system time for testing session timeouts
- **Commit Timestamps:** Mock git commit timestamps for consistency testing
