# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Transparent Work Sessions Integration
> Created: 2025-08-24
> GitHub Issue: #75
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Integrate work session batching transparently into core Agent OS workflows to eliminate excessive commit spam while maintaining workflow quality and hygiene enforcement. This feature will automatically manage commit batching during proper Agent OS workflows, reducing the 16+ commit problem to logical, meaningful commits at natural boundaries.

## User Stories

### Transparent Batching During Execute Tasks

As a developer using Agent OS, I want work sessions to automatically start when I use `/execute-tasks` on a proper workflow (clean git + spec + issue), so that multiple file operations are batched into logical commits without me having to manage session state manually.

The system should detect when I'm following proper Agent OS patterns and seamlessly enable batching, committing at natural boundaries like subtask completion, test validation, and PR creation, while maintaining the same quality standards.

### Helpful Workflow Guidance

As a developer attempting to use Agent OS workflows, I want the system to provide helpful guidance when my workspace isn't ready (dirty git, missing spec, no issue), so that I can quickly get into proper workflow state rather than being blocked by cryptic errors.

When workflow conditions aren't met, the system should clearly explain what needs to be fixed and offer an override option for edge cases, while making it easy to follow proper Agent OS patterns.

## Spec Scope

1. **Auto-start Work Sessions** - Automatically detect proper workflow conditions in `/execute-tasks` and enable transparent batching
2. **Logical Commit Boundaries** - Create commits at natural workflow boundaries (subtasks, tests, PR creation) rather than every file operation
3. **Helpful Workflow Enforcement** - Replace cryptic blocks with clear guidance and override options when workflow isn't proper
4. **Transparent Operation** - Users should be unaware of session management unless they choose to interact with it explicitly
5. **Command Path Resolution** - Fix `/execute-tasks` command reference and resolve execute-tasks vs execute-task confusion

## Out of Scope

- Session persistence across Claude Code restarts (future enhancement)
- Manual session management UI (keep existing `/work-session` commands as optional)
- Team collaboration features (reserved for Phase 2)
- Advanced batching strategies beyond subtask boundaries

## Expected Deliverable

1. Developers using `/execute-tasks` on proper workflows experience logical commit patterns (2-4 commits instead of 16+)
2. Developers with improper workflow setup receive clear, actionable guidance instead of cryptic error messages
3. All existing Agent OS quality standards and workflow enforcement continue to work as designed
