# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Claude Code Hooks Implementation Research and Improvement
> Created: 2025-08-18
> GitHub Issue: #62
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Research and improve the current Claude Code hooks implementation to ensure we're using them correctly according to best practices, enhance their reliability and performance, and provide better user experience through simplified installation and comprehensive documentation.

## User Stories

### Hook Implementation Research

As an Agent OS developer, I want to thoroughly research Claude Code hooks documentation and best practices, so that our current implementation aligns with intended usage patterns and we can identify areas for improvement.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer reviews official Claude Code hooks documentation
2. Developer analyzes current Agent OS hooks implementation
3. Developer compares current implementation against best practices
4. Developer identifies gaps, inefficiencies, or incorrect usage patterns
5. Developer documents findings and creates improvement recommendations

### Performance and Reliability Enhancement

As an Agent OS user, I want Claude Code hooks to work reliably and efficiently, so that my development workflow is smooth and doesn't introduce delays or failures.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User installs Agent OS with Claude Code hooks
2. User works on Agent OS projects with Claude Code
3. Hooks operate transparently without performance impact
4. Hooks successfully enforce workflow rules and provide context
5. User experiences consistent, reliable AI assistance with proper Agent OS integration

### Simplified Installation and Documentation

As an Agent OS user, I want clear documentation and simple installation process for Claude Code hooks, so that I can quickly set up and understand how the hooks enhance my development experience.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User follows installation documentation
2. User understands what each hook does and when it activates
3. User can troubleshoot common issues using provided documentation
4. User can customize hook behavior if needed
5. User successfully integrates hooks into their development workflow

## Spec Scope

1. **Documentation Research** - Comprehensive analysis of Claude Code hooks documentation, examples, and best practices
2. **Implementation Analysis** - Detailed review of current Agent OS hooks implementation for correctness and efficiency
3. **Performance Improvements** - Optimize hook execution speed, reduce overhead, and enhance reliability
4. **Enhanced Documentation** - Create user-friendly documentation explaining hooks functionality and troubleshooting
5. **Installation Simplification** - Streamline the hook installation process and reduce setup complexity

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of hooks system (focus on improvement, not replacement)
- Adding new hook types beyond the current three (stop, postToolUse, userPromptSubmit)
- Integration with other AI tools beyond Claude Code
- Backward compatibility with older versions of Claude Code

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Research findings** documenting current vs. recommended Claude Code hooks usage
2. **Improved hooks implementation** with better performance, reliability, and correctness
3. **Enhanced user documentation** explaining hooks functionality and troubleshooting guide
4. **Simplified installation process** with better error handling and user guidance
