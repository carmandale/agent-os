## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Hook Function Tests**
- Test each hook function in isolation
- Validate hook configuration parsing
- Test error handling for malformed inputs
- Verify cleanup and resource management

**Configuration Management Tests**
- Test hook installation and removal
- Validate configuration file parsing
- Test backup and restore functionality
- Verify permission handling

**Performance Tests**
- Benchmark hook execution time
- Memory usage profiling
- Resource cleanup verification
- Concurrent execution testing

### Integration Tests

**Claude Code Integration**
- Full workflow testing with actual Claude Code sessions
- Hook activation and deactivation scenarios
- Context injection and workflow enforcement testing
- Real project workflow validation

**Agent OS Workflow Integration**
- Test hooks within complete Agent OS workflows
- Validate integration with hygiene checking
- Test interaction with subagents system
- Verify proper handling of interruptions

**Installation Process Testing**
- Fresh installation scenarios
- Update/upgrade scenarios
- Rollback and recovery testing
- Cross-platform compatibility validation

### End-to-End Scenarios

**Complete User Workflows**
- New user installation and setup
- Experienced user upgrade process
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Advanced configuration scenarios

**Performance Scenarios**
- Large project performance testing
- Multiple concurrent Claude Code sessions
- Long-running development sessions
- Resource-constrained environments

## Mocking Requirements

- **Claude Code CLI:** Mock for testing installation detection and configuration
- **File System Operations:** Mock for testing hook file management
- **Process Management:** Mock for testing hook execution and monitoring
- **GitHub API:** Mock for testing workflow integration scenarios

## Test Data Requirements

- Example Agent OS project structures
- Performance benchmark baselines
- Known error scenarios and edge cases

## Success Criteria

- 100% test coverage for hook core functionality
- Performance tests showing < 100ms execution time
- Integration tests passing with real Claude Code workflows
- Installation tests succeeding on clean environments
- Documentation tests validating user experience flows
