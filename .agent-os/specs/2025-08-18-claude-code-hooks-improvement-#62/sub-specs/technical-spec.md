# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-18-claude-code-hooks-improvement-#62/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-18
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Documentation Research Requirements
- Complete analysis of Claude Code hooks official documentation
- Review of Claude Code hooks examples and recommended patterns
- Comparison matrix of current Agent OS implementation vs. documented best practices
- Performance benchmarking of current hooks implementation
- Identification of any deprecated or incorrect usage patterns

### Performance and Reliability Requirements
- Hook execution time must remain under 100ms for routine operations
- Memory usage optimization to prevent Claude Code performance degradation
- Error handling improvements to gracefully handle edge cases
- Consistent behavior across different operating systems (macOS, Linux)
- Proper cleanup and resource management in hook implementations

### Documentation Requirements
- User-friendly installation guide with step-by-step instructions
- Troubleshooting section covering common issues and solutions
- Technical reference documenting each hook's purpose and behavior
- Performance tuning guide for advanced users
- Integration examples showing hooks in action

### Installation Process Requirements
- Automated detection of existing Claude Code installation
- Backup and rollback capabilities for hook installation
- Clear error messages with actionable solutions
- Validation of successful hook installation
- Support for both fresh installations and updates

## Approach Options

**Option A: Incremental Improvement**
- Pros: Lower risk, maintains current functionality, easier to test
- Cons: May not address fundamental architectural issues, limited impact

**Option B: Comprehensive Refactor** (Selected)
- Pros: Addresses root causes, opportunity for significant improvements, cleaner architecture
- Cons: Higher implementation complexity, requires thorough testing

**Option C: Minimal Documentation-Only Approach**
- Pros: Quick to implement, low risk
- Cons: Doesn't address performance or reliability issues, limited value

**Rationale:** Option B is selected because the research phase may reveal fundamental issues that require comprehensive improvements. The Agent OS mission of reliable first-try success demands we address both implementation quality and user experience comprehensively.

## External Dependencies

- **Claude Code CLI** - Latest version with hooks support
- **jq** - JSON processing for hook configuration management
- **gh** - GitHub CLI for integration testing with real workflows

**Justification:** These dependencies are already part of Agent OS ecosystem and essential for hooks functionality. No new external dependencies will be introduced.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Research and Analysis
1. Deep dive into Claude Code hooks documentation
2. Analyze current Agent OS hooks implementation
3. Performance profiling and benchmarking
4. Gap analysis and improvement identification

### Phase 2: Implementation Improvements
1. Optimize hook performance and reliability
2. Enhance error handling and edge case management
3. Improve code organization and maintainability
4. Add comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities

### Phase 3: Documentation and Installation
1. Create comprehensive user documentation
2. Simplify installation process with better automation
3. Add troubleshooting guides and examples
4. Validate improvements with real-world testing

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Individual hook function validation
- **Integration Testing:** Full workflow testing with Claude Code
- **Performance Testing:** Benchmarking against current implementation
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Documentation and installation process validation
