# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Fix Misleading Error Display in /update-documentation Command
> Created: 2025-08-27
> Status: Planning
> Issue: #80

## Overview

The `/update-documentation` command currently displays misleading error messages when functioning correctly due to a mismatch between the script's intentional use of exit codes for signaling (exit code 2 = "documentation updates needed") and Claude Code's expectation that only exit code 0 indicates success. This creates a confusing user experience where successful operations appear to fail with "Error: Bash command failed for pattern" messages.

This specification addresses the core issue by implementing a wrapper script pattern that translates semantic exit codes into user-friendly status messages while maintaining compatibility with both Claude Code's command system and existing CI/CD workflows.

## User Stories

**As a developer using Agent OS,**
I want the `/update-documentation` command to display clear, accurate status messages
So that I can understand whether the command succeeded and what action (if any) is needed.

**As a CI/CD system,**
I want to continue receiving the original semantic exit codes from update-documentation.sh
So that automated workflows can make appropriate decisions based on documentation status.

**As a future Agent OS maintainer,**
I want a documented pattern for handling semantic exit codes in Claude Code commands
So that similar issues can be avoided and resolved consistently.

## Spec Scope

### In Scope
- Create wrapper script for `/update-documentation` command that handles exit code translation
- Implement clear status messaging for different documentation states
- Preserve original script behavior for direct CLI and CI/CD usage
- Document the exit code wrapper pattern for future reference
- Ensure all existing functionality is maintained

### Out of Scope
- Modifying the core update-documentation.sh logic or behavior
- Changing CI/CD workflows or automation that depends on current exit codes
- Implementing similar fixes for other commands (this is a pattern proof-of-concept)
- UI/visual improvements beyond message clarity

## Success Criteria

1. **No False Errors**: The `/update-documentation` command shows no error messages when working correctly
2. **Clear Status Messages**: Users receive explicit feedback about documentation status:
   - "Documentation is up-to-date" when no changes needed
   - "Documentation updates recommended" when changes detected
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Original update-documentation.sh maintains current behavior for direct usage
4. **CI/CD Compatibility**: Automated systems continue receiving semantic exit codes as expected  
5. **Pattern Documentation**: Exit code wrapper pattern is documented for future use
6. **Complete Functionality**: All existing command features and options work unchanged

## Non-Goals

- Redesigning the update-documentation workflow or logic
- Creating a universal exit code handling system for all Agent OS commands
- Modifying Claude Code's command parsing or error handling behavior
- Performance optimization of the documentation checking process

## Assumptions

- Claude Code will continue using the `!` syntax for command execution with current error handling
- Existing CI/CD workflows depend on the current exit code behavior and should not be disrupted  
- The context-aware-wrapper.sh pattern provides a suitable foundation for this implementation
- Users primarily interact with update-documentation through Claude Code rather than direct CLI
- The issue is specific to Claude Code interaction and doesn't affect other AI tools

## Dependencies

- **Technical**: Access to existing context-aware-wrapper.sh implementation for pattern reference
- **Workflow**: Must follow Agent OS development workflow (source → install → deploy)  
- **Documentation**: Update to Claude Code command documentation may be needed
- **Testing**: Verification with both Claude Code and direct CLI usage

## Risks

### Technical Risks
- **Wrapper Complexity**: Additional layer could introduce unexpected behavior or edge cases
- **Performance Impact**: Extra wrapper execution could slow command response time
- **Maintenance Burden**: Additional script to maintain and test

### Process Risks  
- **Breaking Changes**: Risk of inadvertently changing behavior that other systems depend on
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Missing edge cases where the wrapper doesn't handle exit codes properly
- **Documentation Drift**: Pattern documentation becoming outdated as implementation evolves

### Mitigation Strategies
- Thorough testing with both interactive and automated usage patterns
- Clear separation between wrapper and original script responsibilities
- Comprehensive documentation with examples and troubleshooting guidance

## Expected Deliverable

A complete solution that eliminates misleading error messages in the `/update-documentation` command while preserving all existing functionality, consisting of:

1. **Wrapper Script**: New wrapper following context-aware-wrapper.sh pattern
2. **Command Integration**: Updated Claude Code command configuration  
3. **Documentation**: Pattern documentation for future reference
4. **Testing**: Verification that all functionality works in both Claude Code and CI/CD contexts
