# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Context-Aware Workflow Enforcement Enhancement
> Created: 2025-08-11
> GitHub Issue: #22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance Agent OS workflow enforcement hooks with intelligent context analysis to distinguish between new feature work (requiring clean workspace) and legitimate maintenance work (allowed with dirty workspace/open PRs). This eliminates friction when users need to fix issues in existing work while maintaining workflow discipline for new development.

## User Stories

### Maintenance Work Freedom

As a developer using Agent OS, I want to fix failing tests or address CI failures without being blocked by workflow enforcement, so that I can quickly resolve issues in existing work without unnecessary friction.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User has open PR with failing tests
2. User asks "fix the failing authentication tests"  
3. Agent OS recognizes this as maintenance work
4. Work proceeds without requiring clean workspace
5. User can fix tests and update the existing PR

### New Work Discipline

As a developer using Agent OS, I want new feature development to still require a clean workspace and proper spec creation, so that I maintain organized, well-planned development practices for substantial new work.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User asks "implement user profile dashboard"
2. Agent OS recognizes this as new feature work
3. Hooks enforce clean workspace and spec requirement
4. User must clean up existing work before proceeding
5. New feature gets proper planning and clean development environment

### Edge Case Handling

As a developer using Agent OS, I want clear feedback and override options when my work intent is ambiguous, so that I can proceed with confidence while understanding the workflow implications.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User asks "update the user authentication system"
2. Agent OS detects ambiguous intent (could be new feature or maintenance)
3. System prompts for clarification with clear options
4. User selects maintenance or new work path
5. Appropriate workflow enforcement applies

## Spec Scope

1. **Smart Intent Analysis** - Analyze user messages to categorize work as maintenance vs new development
2. **Context-Aware Hook Enhancement** - Modify existing workflow hooks to respect maintenance work exceptions  
3. **Manual Override System** - Provide escape mechanisms for edge cases and user preference
4. **Clear User Feedback** - Display reasoning and options when work type is detected or ambiguous
5. **Maintenance Work Pattern Recognition** - Identify patterns like "fix", "debug", "address CI", "resolve conflicts"

## Out of Scope

- Advanced natural language processing or machine learning for intent detection
- Complete rewrite of existing hook system
- GUI or web interface for override management
- Integration with external project management tools

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Enhanced Workflow Enforcement** - Users can perform maintenance work without being blocked by dirty workspace/open PRs
2. **Maintained New Work Discipline** - New feature development still requires proper workspace hygiene and spec creation  
3. **Clear User Experience** - Users understand why they're being blocked or allowed to proceed with helpful messaging
