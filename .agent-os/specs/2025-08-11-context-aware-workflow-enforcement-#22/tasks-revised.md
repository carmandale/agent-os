## Critical Issues Identified

ðŸš¨ **BLOCKING ISSUES** discovered during expert review:
1. Interactive input() will hang Claude Code - CRITICAL
2. Performance 5x slower than requirement (500ms vs 100ms) - MAJOR
3. Missing circuit breakers create security bypasses - MAJOR
4. No integration testing for Claude Code compatibility - MAJOR

  - [x] 1.2 Implement IntentAnalyzer class with pattern matching
  - [x] 1.3 Add configuration system for customizable patterns
  - [x] 1.4 Implement ambiguous intent detection and handling
  - [x] 1.5 Add logging and debugging for intent decisions
  - [x] 1.6 Verify all tests pass for intent analysis functionality

- [x] 2. Develop Context-Aware Hook Wrapper âœ… **COMPLETE** (PR #24 merged)
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for context-aware hook wrapper functionality
  - [x] 2.2 Create ContextAwareWorkflowHook class that wraps existing hooks
  - [x] 2.3 Implement workspace state evaluation for different work types
  - [x] 2.4 Add integration with intent analyzer for work type decisions
  - [x] 2.5 Preserve existing hook behavior for backward compatibility
  - [x] 2.6 Verify all tests pass for hook wrapper functionality

### Phase 2: Safe Integration (After Critical Fixes)

- [ ] 3. Hook Integration with Hybrid Wrapper Approach
  - [ ] 3.1 Create lightweight bash wrapper script
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement fast-path optimizations
  - [ ] 3.3 Add environment variable controls
  - [ ] 3.4 Create rollback mechanism
  - [ ] 3.5 Test with real Claude Code workflows
  - [ ] 3.6 Document integration process

- [ ] 4. Configuration and Override System
  - [ ] 4.1 Implement YAML configuration loading
  - [ ] 4.2 Add pattern customization support
  - [ ] 4.3 Create override environment variables
  - [ ] 4.4 Add configuration validation
  - [ ] 4.5 Test configuration hot-reload
  - [ ] 4.6 Document configuration options

### Phase 3: Production Readiness

- [ ] 5. Monitoring and Observability
  - [ ] 5.1 Add performance metrics collection
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement error rate tracking
  - [ ] 5.3 Create usage analytics
  - [ ] 5.4 Add debug logging modes
  - [ ] 5.5 Create monitoring dashboard
  - [ ] 5.6 Test alerting mechanisms

- [ ] 6. Documentation and Rollout
  - [ ] 6.1 Create user documentation
  - [ ] 6.2 Write troubleshooting guide
  - [ ] 6.3 Document rollback procedures
  - [ ] 6.4 Create migration guide from old hooks
  - [ ] 6.5 Add example configurations
  - [ ] 6.6 Prepare release notes

## Success Criteria

### Before Integration
- [ ] No interactive prompts that can hang Claude Code
- [ ] Performance consistently <100ms
- [ ] All failure modes have safe defaults
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage >90%

### After Integration
- [ ] Zero Claude Code workflow disruptions
- [ ] User satisfaction increased (fewer false blocks)
- [ ] Easy rollback available
- [ ] Clear monitoring and alerting

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Staged Rollout**: Test with volunteer users first
2. **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable via environment variables
3. **Instant Rollback**: One-command restoration to original state
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics on performance and errors

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Complete Phase 0 (Critical Fixes)
- **Week 2**: Phase 2 (Safe Integration)
- **Week 3**: Phase 3 (Production Readiness)
- **Week 4**: Staged rollout with monitoring

## Notes

The expert analysis revealed that our current implementation would harm user experience by hanging Claude Code. We must complete Phase 0 before any integration attempts. The hybrid wrapper approach is architecturally sound but requires these critical fixes first.
