This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-11-context-aware-workflow-enforcement-#22/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-11
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**IntentAnalyzer Class**
- Test maintenance work pattern detection (fix tests, debug, address CI)
- Test new work pattern detection (implement feature, build new, create component)
- Test ambiguous message handling (mixed or unclear intent)
- Test configuration loading and pattern customization
- Test edge cases (empty messages, special characters, very long messages)

**ContextAwareWorkflowHook Class**  
- Test workspace state evaluation for different work types
- Test hook wrapping functionality preserves original behavior
- Test override mechanism activation and handling
- Test error handling when original hooks fail
- Test configuration integration with hook decisions

**Configuration Management**
- Test YAML configuration file parsing
- Test default pattern loading when config missing
- Test pattern validation and sanitization
- Test configuration reload without restart

### Integration Tests

**End-to-End Workflow Scenarios**
- Test maintenance work allowed with dirty workspace
- Test new work blocked with dirty workspace  
- Test new work allowed with clean workspace
- Test ambiguous intent prompting and user response handling
- Test manual override functionality from command line

**Hook System Integration**
- Test integration with existing workflow-enforcement-hook.py
- Test preservation of existing hook error messages and behaviors
- Test hook chaining and execution order
- Test hook performance with context-aware wrapper

**Git Integration Scenarios**
- Test detection of workspace states (clean, dirty, open PRs)
- Test proper handling of different git repository states
- Test integration with existing git workflow commands
- Test branch state consideration in work type decisions

### Feature Tests

**Real-World Usage Scenarios**
- User says "fix failing authentication tests" with open PR → allowed
- User says "implement user dashboard" with open PR → blocked  
- User says "update user authentication system" → prompted for clarification
- User uses manual override flag → bypasses all restrictions
- User configures custom maintenance patterns → patterns respected in decisions

**Error Recovery Scenarios**
- Intent analyzer fails → falls back to original hook behavior
- Configuration file corrupted → uses default patterns with warning
- Original hook script missing → clear error message with guidance
- Network or filesystem issues → graceful degradation

### Mocking Requirements

**Git Command Mocking**
- Mock git status responses for different workspace states
- Mock git branch information for PR detection
- Mock git log for recent commit analysis

**File System Mocking**
- Mock configuration file existence and contents
- Mock hook script file permissions and execution
- Mock Agent OS directory structure

**User Interaction Mocking**  
- Mock user input for ambiguous intent scenarios
- Mock command-line argument parsing
- Mock terminal output and error message display

## Test Data Sets

### Message Classification Test Cases

**Clear Maintenance Work Messages:**
```
"fix the failing unit tests"
"debug authentication issues"  
"resolve merge conflicts in PR #123"
"address CI pipeline failures"
"fix bug in user validation"
"update dependencies to resolve security issues"
```

**Clear New Work Messages:**
```
"implement user profile dashboard"  
"build new authentication system"
"create payment processing feature"
"add real-time notifications"
"develop admin panel interface"
```

**Ambiguous Messages:**
```
"update the user authentication system"
"refactor the database layer"  
"improve the UI components"
"work on the API endpoints"
"handle the user management features"
```

### Workspace State Test Cases

**Clean Workspace:**
- No uncommitted changes
- No untracked files  
- No open PRs
- On main/default branch

**Dirty Workspace Scenarios:**
- Uncommitted changes in working directory
- Untracked files present
- Open PRs requiring attention
- Feature branch with work in progress

## Performance Testing

**Intent Analysis Performance:**
- Test response time for typical user messages (<100ms target)
- Test memory usage with large configuration files
- Test pattern compilation and caching efficiency
- Test concurrent request handling if applicable

**Hook Integration Performance:**
- Measure overhead added to existing hook execution (<10% target)
- Test startup time impact with wrapper initialization
- Test configuration loading time on first execution
- Test overall workflow delay introduced by context analysis

## Security Testing

**Input Validation:**
- Test handling of malicious user input patterns
- Test configuration file injection attempts
- Test path traversal attempts in configuration
- Test regex denial-of-service (ReDoS) prevention

**Permission and Access:**
- Test proper file permission handling for configurations
- Test hook execution with different user permissions
- Test access to git repository information
- Test configuration file modification restrictions
