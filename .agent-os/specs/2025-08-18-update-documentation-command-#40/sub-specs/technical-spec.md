# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-18-update-documentation-command-#40/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-18
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Command Interface
- Maintain existing `/update-documentation` command interface
- Add `--deep` flag for comprehensive audit mode  
- Preserve output format compatibility for existing users
- Return appropriate exit codes (0 for clean, 1 for issues found)

### Normal Mode Functionality
- Check recent commits in CHANGELOG.md (last 30 days)
- Verify open issues have corresponding specs in `.agent-os/specs/`
- Check that recent PRs are documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Validate core Agent OS files exist and are readable
- Report common documentation drift patterns

### Deep Mode Functionality  
- Cross-reference all GitHub issues with specs
- Validate all spec references point to existing files
- Check roadmap items against actual implementation
- Verify all Claude Code commands are documented
- Validate all file references in Agent OS documentation
- Check `.agent-os/product/` completeness

### Evidence-Based Operation
- Only report factual findings from actual file analysis
- No assumptions or fabricated recommendations
- Show specific file paths and line numbers where applicable
- Provide exact command outputs and git information
- Clear separation between facts and suggestions

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Shell Script Implementation (Selected)
- Pros: Consistent with Agent OS architecture, no new dependencies, fast execution
- Cons: More complex for deep file analysis, limited JSON processing

**Option B:** Python Script Implementation  
- Pros: Better text processing, easier JSON/YAML parsing, more robust file analysis
- Cons: Adds Python dependency, inconsistent with shell-first Agent OS approach

**Rationale:** Shell script maintains architectural consistency while leveraging existing Agent OS patterns. Complex analysis can use standard Unix tools (grep, awk, jq).

## External Dependencies

- **jq** (for JSON processing of GitHub API responses)
- **gh CLI** (for GitHub issue/PR data - already required by Agent OS)
- **git** (for commit analysis - already required by Agent OS)

**Justification:** All dependencies are already required by Agent OS core functionality, so no new external dependencies are introduced.
