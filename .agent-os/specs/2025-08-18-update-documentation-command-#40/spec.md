# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Fix /update-documentation Command
> Created: 2025-08-18
> GitHub Issue: #40
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the /update-documentation command to properly detect documentation drift instead of checking database configurations. The command should provide a comprehensive documentation health check for Agent OS installations, validating that all documentation is current, complete, and aligned with actual implementation state.

## User Stories

### Documentation Health Check

As a Agent OS user, I want to run `/update-documentation` to quickly identify documentation drift, so that I can maintain accurate project documentation without manual auditing.

**Workflow**: User runs command → system analyzes documentation completeness → provides actionable report with specific fixes needed → user can address gaps efficiently.

### Deep Documentation Audit

As a Agent OS maintainer, I want to run `/update-documentation --deep` to perform comprehensive documentation validation, so that I can ensure all Agent OS components are properly documented and cross-referenced.

**Workflow**: Maintainer runs deep mode → system performs exhaustive checks across all Agent OS documentation → generates detailed audit report → maintainer can systematically address all documentation issues.

## Spec Scope

1. **Normal Mode Operation** - Quick documentation health check focusing on recent activity and common drift patterns
2. **Deep Mode Operation** - Comprehensive audit of all Agent OS documentation relationships and completeness  
3. **Evidence-Based Reporting** - Only report factual findings without fabrication or assumptions
4. **Agent OS Documentation Focus** - Target core Agent OS files: `.agent-os/product/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`, GitHub issues/PRs
5. **Actionable Output** - Provide specific, actionable recommendations for fixing identified issues

## Out of Scope

- Database configuration validation (current broken behavior)
- Non-Agent OS documentation files
- Automatic documentation fixes (command only reports issues)
- Documentation content quality assessment
- Grammar or style checking

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fixed `/update-documentation` command that properly detects documentation drift
2. Normal mode provides quick check of recent activity and common issues
3. Deep mode provides comprehensive audit of all Agent OS documentation relationships
4. Clear, actionable output that helps users maintain documentation health
