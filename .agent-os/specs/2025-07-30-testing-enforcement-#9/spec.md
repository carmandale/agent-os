# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Testing Enforcement Before Completion Claims
> Created: 2025-07-30
> GitHub Issue: #9
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enforce actual testing before completion claims to eliminate "broken complete features" by requiring Claude to run tests, verify functionality, and demonstrate working features before marking any work as finished.

**CLAUDE CODE INTEGRATION NOTE**: This solution integrates with the completed Claude Code hooks system (Issue #37) and directly supports verification proof requirements (Issue #8). Testing enforcement will operate through workflow modules and hooks to block completion claims until testing is proven complete.

## User Stories

### No More Broken "Complete" Features

As a developer using Agent OS, I want Claude to actually test features before claiming they're complete, so that I never receive "finished" work that doesn't function.

**Current Problem:** Claude marks features complete without testing:
- Writes authentication code but never tests login process
- Creates scripts but never executes them to verify they work
- Implements APIs but never calls them to check responses
- Claims "all tests passing" without running test suite

**Expected Workflow:** Claude must demonstrate working functionality through actual testing before any completion claims are allowed.

### Test-Driven Completion Process

As a developer, I want Agent OS to enforce a testing requirement where features cannot be marked complete until testing evidence is provided, so that completion actually means "tested and working."

**Required Testing Evidence:**
- Unit tests: Show test execution with pass/fail results
- Integration tests: Demonstrate API calls and database operations
- Frontend features: Browser testing with user interaction proof
- Scripts: Command execution with successful output

### Testing Quality Assurance

As a team using Agent OS, I want confidence that when work is marked complete, it has been properly tested and validated, so that completed features can be immediately deployed or reviewed.

**Testing Standards:**
- All new code must have passing tests written and executed
- All features must be functionally validated through actual usage
- All APIs must be tested with real requests and responses
- All scripts must be executed to prove they work

## Spec Scope

1. **Testing Requirement Enforcement** - Block completion claims until testing evidence is provided
2. **Test Execution Validation** - Verify that tests were actually run, not just written
3. **Functional Testing Requirements** - Define what functional validation is needed for different work types
4. **Hook Integration** - Use Claude Code hooks to prevent completion without testing
5. **Testing Evidence Standards** - Specify what constitutes adequate testing proof

## Out of Scope

- Comprehensive test coverage metrics or advanced testing analytics
- Performance testing or load testing requirements
- Third-party testing service integration
- Manual testing guidance for complex UI scenarios

## Expected Deliverable

1. **No completion without testing** - Claude cannot mark work complete without running tests and showing results
2. **Functional validation required** - All features must be demonstrated working through actual usage
3. **Testing evidence enforced** - Test execution output, functional proof, and validation results required for completion
