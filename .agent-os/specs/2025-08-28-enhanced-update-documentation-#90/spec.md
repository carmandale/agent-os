# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Enhanced Update Documentation System
> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the `/update-documentation` command from a passive documentation checker into an intelligent documentation updater that automatically maintains CHANGELOG.md, spec directories, roadmap status tracking, and fixes broken references across the Agent OS codebase.

## User Stories

**As a Developer**, I want the `/update-documentation` command to automatically update my CHANGELOG.md so that release notes stay current without manual maintenance.

**As a Product Manager**, I want spec directories to be automatically organized and roadmap status to reflect actual completion so that project tracking is always accurate.

**As a Team Member**, I want broken documentation references to be automatically fixed so that I don't encounter dead links when following Agent OS workflows.

**As a Maintainer**, I want comprehensive documentation drift detection and correction so that the codebase documentation remains trustworthy and up-to-date.

## Spec Scope

### Core Auto-Update Features

1. **CHANGELOG.md Generation**
   - Parse git commits since last release
   - Generate structured changelog entries
   - Maintain semantic versioning alignment
   - Preserve manual changelog additions

2. **Spec Directory Management**
   - Auto-generate spec-lite.md from full specs
   - Update spec completion status
   - Organize specs by date and completion status
   - Clean up obsolete or duplicate specs

3. **Roadmap Status Synchronization**
   - Scan completed specs and tasks
   - Update roadmap.md completion markers
   - Track feature delivery against planned phases
   - Generate progress summaries

4. **Reference Link Healing**
   - Detect broken @ references in markdown files
   - Automatically fix relocatable references
   - Report unfixable broken links
   - Validate external links and suggest alternatives

### Documentation Quality Assurance

5. **Consistency Enforcement**
   - Standardize markdown formatting
   - Ensure consistent date formats
   - Validate spec template compliance
   - Check decision log formatting

6. **Content Validation**
   - Verify code examples are current
   - Check that instructions match actual file paths
   - Validate workflow step sequences
   - Ensure examples reference existing files

## Out of Scope

- Manual content editing (preserves human-written content)
- Complex content rewrites (focuses on structural updates)
- External dependency documentation (GitHub, third-party tools)
- Historical data modification (maintains audit trail)
- Live documentation serving (remains file-based)

## Expected Deliverable

An enhanced `/update-documentation` command that:

1. **Operates in multiple modes**: `--check` (current behavior), `--update` (new auto-update), `--fix-refs` (reference healing), `--sync-roadmap` (status sync)

2. **Provides comprehensive reporting** showing what was updated, what issues were found, and what manual intervention is needed

3. **Maintains backward compatibility** with existing documentation checker functionality while adding powerful auto-update capabilities

4. **Integrates with Agent OS workflows** through hooks and can be run automatically before commits or releases

5. **Respects user content** by preserving manually written sections while updating structural and generated content
