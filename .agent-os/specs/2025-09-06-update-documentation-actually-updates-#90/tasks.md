## Implementation Strategy

### TDD Approach
- **Tests First**: Each major task starts with comprehensive test writing
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Implement functionality to make tests pass, then optimize
- **Integration Testing**: Validate component interactions work correctly
- **End-to-End Validation**: Test complete workflows in realistic scenarios

### Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Development**: Build and test each component independently
- **Extensive Mocking**: Reduce external dependencies during development
- **Rollback Planning**: Ensure all operations can be safely reversed via git
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios and recovery procedures

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 95% test coverage for all components
- **Performance**: All operations complete within 30-second requirement
- **Security**: No file system access outside project directory
- **Compatibility**: Existing workflows continue to function correctly
- **Documentation**: Complete user and developer documentation

## Dependency Management

### Critical Dependencies
- **GitHub CLI (gh)** - Required for PR/issue information
- **jq** - Essential for JSON processing
- **git** - Core functionality dependency

### Optional Dependencies  
- **Python 3.8+** - Enhanced functionality for complex operations
- **curl** - Fallback for API operations

### Environment Requirements
- **Git repository** - Must be run within git-tracked project
- **Write permissions** - Must have write access to documentation files
- **Network access** - Required for GitHub API integration (optional for offline mode)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tests pass with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Command actually updates documentation files (not just analyzes)
- [ ] Performance meets 30-second requirement for full updates
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing workflows
- [ ] Preview mode provides accurate change previews
- [ ] Verification mode properly detects documentation currency
- [ ] Error handling provides clear recovery guidance
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect actual functionality
- [ ] CI/CD integration works with proper exit codes
- [ ] Security review passes with no critical issues

## Timeline Estimate

**Total Estimated Time:** 120-140 hours
**Recommended Timeline:** 6-8 weeks with proper testing
**Critical Path:** Test framework → Core engines → Integration → Quality assurance
**Parallel Work Opportunities:** Component development can happen concurrently after test framework completion

This comprehensive implementation plan transforms the misleading `/update-documentation` command into the fully functional documentation update system users expect, following Agent OS quality standards and TDD best practices.
