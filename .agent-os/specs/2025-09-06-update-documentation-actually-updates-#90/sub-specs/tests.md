### Integration Tests

**Full Command Execution**
- Test complete `/update-documentation` run with all flags
- Test `--preview` mode shows correct changes without applying
- Test `--verify` mode correctly detects documentation currency
- Test `--force` mode bypasses safety checks appropriately
- Test granular flags work in isolation and combination

**GitHub Integration**

- Test graceful degradation when GitHub API unavailable
- Test handling of private repositories and permissions
- Test rate limiting and API error handling

**Git Integration**
- Test operation on clean and dirty git repositories
- Test respect for .gitignore patterns
- Test handling of untracked files
- Test integration with various git configurations

**File System Operations**
- Test file modification atomicity
- Test permission handling for read-only files
- Test handling of missing or corrupted documentation files
- Test operation on symbolic links and special files

**Error Recovery**
- Test recovery from network failures during GitHub API calls
- Test recovery from file system errors during updates
- Test recovery from malformed JSON responses
- Test recovery from interrupted operations

### Feature Tests

**CHANGELOG.md Auto-Update Workflow**
- Create test repository with recent PRs
- Run `/update-documentation --update-changelog`
- Verify CHANGELOG.md contains new PR entries with correct formatting
- Verify duplicate PRs are not added on subsequent runs
- Verify existing CHANGELOG format is preserved

**Roadmap Synchronization Workflow**  
- Create test roadmap with mix of open/closed issues
- Close issues referenced in roadmap
- Run `/update-documentation --sync-roadmap`
- Verify roadmap items marked complete
- Verify progress percentages updated correctly

**Broken Reference Repair Workflow**
- Create documentation with broken `@` file references
- Move/rename files to create additional broken references
- Run `/update-documentation --fix-references`
- Verify all references point to correct files
- Verify repair report shows all changes made

**Preview Mode Workflow**
- Set up repository with various documentation updates needed
- Run `/update-documentation --preview`
- Verify preview shows all pending changes
- Verify no actual changes are made to files
- Run without `--preview` and verify actual changes match preview

**Verification Mode Workflow**
- Set up current documentation (no updates needed)
- Run `/update-documentation --verify` and verify exit code 0
- Modify repository to need documentation updates
- Run `/update-documentation --verify` and verify exit code 1
- Verify specific recommendations provided

**Combined Operations Workflow**
- Set up repository needing multiple types of documentation updates
- Run `/update-documentation --update-changelog --sync-roadmap --fix-references`  
- Verify all update types applied correctly in single run
- Verify atomic behavior (all succeed or all fail)

### Mocking Requirements

**GitHub API Service**
- Mock GitHub CLI (`gh`) responses for PR and issue data
- Mock network failures and authentication errors
- Mock rate limiting scenarios
- Mock various repository configurations (public/private)

**File System Operations**
- Mock file permission errors
- Mock disk space limitations
- Mock concurrent file access scenarios
- Mock symbolic link and special file handling

**Git Operations**
- Mock various git repository states (clean, dirty, detached HEAD)
- Mock git command failures
- Mock different git configurations
- Mock repositories with and without remote origins

**External Dependencies**
- Mock `jq` availability and functionality
- Mock Python availability for optional features
- Mock network connectivity for GitHub operations
- Mock various shell environments and capabilities

### Performance Tests

**Large Repository Handling**
- Test performance with repositories containing hundreds of PRs
- Test performance with large CHANGELOG.md files (>1MB)
- Test performance with complex roadmap files
- Verify all operations complete within 30-second requirement

**Concurrent Operation Testing**
- Test behavior when multiple instances run simultaneously
- Test file locking and atomic operation guarantees
- Test resource usage under concurrent load

**Memory and Resource Usage**
- Test memory usage with large API responses
- Test temporary file cleanup
- Test resource usage during error conditions

### Security Tests

**Input Validation**
- Test handling of malicious file content
- Test handling of malformed GitHub API responses
- Test handling of files with unusual permissions
- Test path traversal protection in file operations

**File System Security**
- Test that operations stay within project directory
- Test handling of symbolic links pointing outside project
- Test respect for file system permissions
- Test behavior with read-only file systems

### Regression Tests

**Backward Compatibility**
- Test that existing workflows continue to function
- Test that old flag combinations still work (where applicable)
- Test that command output format remains compatible
- Test that exit codes maintain expected behavior

**Integration with Agent OS**
