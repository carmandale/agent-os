> Spec: Builder Methods Subagents System Integration
> Created: 2025-08-14
> GitHub Issue: #25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Integrate Builder Methods' Specialized Subagents System as a mandatory, always-on enhancement that automatically improves Agent OS operations through intelligent agent selection, reducing context usage by 25% and improving first-try success rates without requiring any user configuration or opt-in processes.

## User Stories

### Seamless Agent Enhancement

As an Agent OS user, I want the system to automatically use specialized subagents for optimal task execution, so that I get better results without learning new commands or configuration steps.

**Detailed Workflow:**
When I run any Agent OS workflow, the system automatically detects the best subagent (context-fetcher, date-checker, file-creator, git-workflow, or test-runner) for each operation and uses it transparently. I experience faster, more accurate results with reduced token usage, but the interface remains identical to what I'm familiar with.

### Backward Compatibility Preservation

As an existing Agent OS user, I want all my current workflows to continue working exactly as before, so that I can benefit from improvements without any disruption or relearning.

**Detailed Workflow:**
All existing commands, file structures, and workflows function identically. The enhancement happens under the hood - my muscle memory and scripts continue working while performance and accuracy improve automatically.

### Enhanced Performance Experience

As a developer using AI coding assistants, I want Agent OS operations to be more efficient and accurate, so that I spend less time on context management and get better first-try results.

**Detailed Workflow:**
The system automatically reduces context usage through intelligent subagent selection, provides more accurate date handling, creates better file templates, manages git operations more reliably, and runs tests more effectively - all without me needing to know these improvements are happening.

## Spec Scope

1. **Subagent System Integration** - Port and integrate all 5 specialized subagents with automatic detection and selection
2. **Mandatory Always-On Architecture** - Make subagents work automatically without opt-in or configuration requirements  
3. **Pre-flight Check Enhancement** - Merge Builder Methods pre-flight system with existing hygiene checks
4. **Instruction Reorganization** - Restructure instructions into core/meta directories for better maintainability
5. **Task Tool Enhancement** - Upgrade Claude Code Task integration for automatic subagent selection
6. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure <10ms detection overhead and 25% context usage reduction
7. **Backward Compatibility Guarantee** - Maintain 100% compatibility with existing workflows and commands

## Out of Scope

- Opt-in or configuration interfaces (must be automatic)
- Breaking changes to existing workflows
- User-visible complexity or new commands to learn
- Migration of existing Agent OS installations (seamless upgrade)
- Performance degradation (must maintain or improve current speeds)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Transparent Enhanced Performance** - Users experience improved Agent OS operations without any interface changes or learning curve
2. **Measurable Efficiency Gains** - 25% reduction in context usage and demonstrable accuracy improvements in browser/API testing
3. **Complete Backward Compatibility** - All existing Agent OS users can upgrade seamlessly with no workflow disruption
