# Missing Evidence of Actual Testing

## Problem Statement

PR #101 lacks proof of working functionality, violating Agent OS Decision DEC-005 (Critical Quality Enforcement). The PR description includes test command examples but no actual execution output demonstrating that the `/merge` command works as intended.

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Quality Standards Violation
**Agent OS Standard:** DEC-005, CLAUDE.md Evidence-Based Development Protocol

## Findings

- Discovered during architecture review and quality standards verification
- Location: PR #101 description, test results section
- Violates Agent OS requirement: "Show actual command output - Never claim tests pass without showing output"
- Missing proof of: merge execution, worktree cleanup, error handling, validation checks
- Current PR shows commands but not their actual output

### Agent OS Requirements

From `CLAUDE.md` Evidence-Based Development Protocol:
```markdown
## Evidence-Based Development Protocol

When working on Agent OS itself:

1. **Show actual command output** - Never claim "tests pass" without showing output
2. **Verify file operations** - After creating/modifying files, show with `ls -la` or `cat`
3. **Prove functionality** - Test changes with real Agent OS workflows
4. **Document evidence** - Include command outputs in PR descriptions

Never mark work complete without:
- Showing test output
- Demonstrating functionality
- Creating proper PR with evidence of working functionality
```

From `DEC-005` (Critical Quality Enforcement Requirements):
```markdown
Implement mandatory verification and testing requirements before any work can be
marked as complete. Claude must prove functionality works through actual testing,
not just assume success after implementation.
```

### Current PR Evidence (Insufficient)

**What PR #101 Contains:**
```markdown
## Test Results / Evidence

### Test 1: Help Text
$ ~/.agent-os/scripts/workflow-merge.sh --help
‚úÖ Help text displays correctly

### Test 2: Syntax Check
$ bash -n scripts/workflow-merge.sh
(no output = success)
‚úÖ Script passes bash syntax validation

### Test 3: Dry-run Without PR
$ ~/.agent-os/scripts/workflow-merge.sh --dry-run
‚ùå ERROR: Could not infer PR number...
‚úÖ Correctly handles case where no PR exists

### Test 4: Dry-run On This PR (#101)
$ ~/.agent-os/scripts/workflow-merge.sh --dry-run 101
[Shows validation output]
‚úÖ Correctly detects missing reviews and failing CI checks
```

**Problems:**
1. ‚ùå No actual command output shown - just claims of success
2. ‚ùå No proof the script was actually executed
3. ‚ùå No demonstration of worktree cleanup (the core feature)
4. ‚ùå No screenshots or terminal captures
5. ‚ùå No verification that tests were real (not fabricated)

### Required Evidence (Missing)

**Category 1: Happy Path - Successful Merge**
```bash
# REQUIRED: Full execution output showing:
$ cd .worktrees/test-feature-#999
$ git worktree list  # Before state
$ /merge 999
[Full output showing:]
- Prerequisites check ‚úì
- PR inference ‚úì
- User confirmation ‚úì
- Pre-merge validation ‚úì
- Merge execution ‚úì
- Worktree detection ‚úì
- Worktree cleanup ‚úì
- Success summary ‚úì

$ git worktree list  # After state (worktree removed)
$ pwd  # Verify returned to main repo
$ git branch  # Show current branch is main
```

**Category 2: Error Handling**
```bash
# Test 1: Invalid PR number
$ /merge "not-a-number"
‚ùå ERROR: Invalid PR number: not-a-number (must contain only digits)

# Test 2: Uncommitted changes (if Issue #003 is fixed)
$ cd .worktrees/dirty-feature
$ echo "test" > file.txt
$ /merge
‚ùå ERROR: Worktree has uncommitted changes
[Shows git status output]
[Shows recovery options]

# Test 3: CI failing
$ /merge 101
[Shows validation checking]
‚ùå ERROR: CI/CD checks not all passing
[Shows which checks failed]
```

**Category 3: Worktree Operations**
```bash
# Verify detection works
$ cd .worktrees/feature-#123
$ ~/.agent-os/scripts/workflow-merge.sh --dry-run 123
[Output shows:]
üîÑ Detecting worktree...
‚úÖ Running in worktree: /path/to/.worktrees/feature-#123
‚úÖ Main repository: /path/to/agent-os

# Verify cleanup works
$ git worktree list
[Shows worktree exists]
/path/to/.worktrees/feature-#123  abc1234 [feature/test]

$ /merge 123
[... merge execution ...]
‚úÖ Worktree cleaned up

$ git worktree list
[Worktree no longer listed]
/path/to/agent-os  main123 [main]

$ pwd
/path/to/agent-os
```

**Category 4: Integration Points**
```bash
# Verify command installation
$ ls ~/.claude/commands/ | grep merge
workflow-merge.md

$ cat ~/.claude/commands/workflow-merge.md | head -5
[Shows YAML frontmatter and description]

# Verify command accessible
$ /merge --help
[Shows help output]
```

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Comprehensive Test Execution (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Proves functionality works, meets Agent OS standards, builds trust
- **Cons**: Time-consuming to set up test scenarios
- **Effort**: Medium (2 hours)
- **Risk**: None - Pure verification work

**Implementation:**
1. Create test PR in a scratch repository
2. Create worktree for test PR
3. Execute actual merge with full output capture
4. Test error scenarios with output capture
5. Take screenshots of terminal sessions
6. Add all evidence to PR description
7. Commit evidence as PR comment or updated description

### Option 2: Minimal Compliance (Alternative)
- **Pros**: Faster to complete
- **Cons**: Doesn't fully demonstrate functionality
- **Effort**: Small (30 minutes)
- **Risk**: Low - Meets minimum requirement

**Implementation:**
1. Run syntax check with output
2. Run --help with output
3. Run --dry-run with output
4. Add to PR description

**Why not recommended:** Doesn't prove the core functionality (merge + cleanup) actually works

### Option 3: Defer Testing (NOT Acceptable)
- **Pros**: No work required
- **Cons**: Violates Agent OS core standards
- **Effort**: None
- **Risk**: HIGH - Undermines quality standards

**Why rejected:** DEC-005 is non-negotiable

## Recommended Action

**Option 1: Comprehensive Test Execution** - This is the only approach that satisfies Agent OS quality standards.

### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Setup Test Environment (15 min)**
1. Create or identify test repository
2. Create test PR with actual code changes
3. Create worktree for test PR
4. Ensure PR is in mergeable state (CI passing, reviews approved)

**Step 2: Execute Happy Path (30 min)**
1. Navigate to worktree
2. Run: `script -a merge-test-output.txt`
3. Execute: `/merge [pr-number]`
4. Capture all output
5. Verify worktree removed: `git worktree list`
6. Verify on main: `pwd`, `git branch`
7. End recording: exit
8. Review output file

**Step 3: Execute Error Scenarios (30 min)**
1. Test invalid PR number
2. Test dirty worktree (if Issue #003 fixed)
3. Test with failing CI
4. Test with missing reviews
5. Capture all error outputs

**Step 4: Document Evidence (30 min)**
1. Format outputs for readability
2. Add section headers
3. Annotate with explanations
4. Include timestamps
5. Add to PR description
6. Create evidence artifact (can be gist or PR comment)

**Step 5: Verification Checklist (15 min)**
- [ ] Actual command outputs shown (not just descriptions)
- [ ] Timestamps prove tests were actually run
- [ ] Success path fully documented
- [ ] Error handling demonstrated
- [ ] Worktree cleanup verified with before/after
- [ ] Integration with Agent OS command system shown

## Technical Details

## Work Log

### 2025-10-15 - Code Review Discovery
**By:** Claude Code Review System (architecture-strategist agent)
**Actions:**
- Reviewed PR #101 against Agent OS quality standards
- Compared PR description to DEC-005 requirements
- Identified lack of actual testing evidence
- Categorized as P0 blocking issue per Agent OS policy
- Created todo for tracking and resolution

**Learnings:**
- "Tests pass" claims without output are red flags
- Evidence-based development prevents fabrication issues
- Actual terminal output builds trust and confidence
- Screenshots/recordings provide stronger proof than text
- Testing evidence should show both success and failure paths
- Agent OS DEC-005 exists because this was a recurring problem

## Notes

**BLOCKING:** This issue MUST be resolved before PR #101 can be merged to main.

**Priority Justification:** Agent OS was created specifically to address the problem of AI assistants claiming "tests pass" without proof. DEC-005 codifies this as a core requirement. Violating this principle in Agent OS's own development would be deeply hypocritical and undermine the framework's credibility.

**Historical Context:** From `DEC-005`:
> User feedback: "you are not really doing the work that you say you are doing"
>
> Users are discovering that Claude consistently marks work as "complete" without
> testing it, leading to: Broken scripts marked as "working", Non-functional
> authentication marked as "‚úì COMPLETE", Tests written but never run, Features
> claimed as done that fail on first use.

**This PR Cannot Repeat That Pattern.**

**Dependencies:** This todo depends on Issues #001-#004 being fixed first, as the actual testing will validate those fixes work correctly.

**Testing Strategy:** Use a real (but low-risk) PR in a test repository. Don't mock the execution - do it for real and capture everything.

**Context:** Final P0 blocking issue in comprehensive review. Once this is complete, PR #101 will have addressed all critical security, data integrity, and quality concerns.
