# Subagent Integration Status

## Current Issue
The subagents are installed but not being triggered because:

1. **Claude Code Hook Limitations**: Claude Code's PreToolUse hooks can only:
   - `allow` - Let the tool proceed
   - `block` - Stop the tool with a message
   - They CANNOT modify tool parameters or inject subagent routing

2. **Task Tool Architecture**: The Task tool in Claude Code doesn't have a way to:
   - Accept modified parameters from hooks
   - Route to different subagent types based on hook input

## What's Working
- ✅ Subagents installed in ~/.agent-os/hooks/subagents/
- ✅ Detection system works (0.01ms performance)
- ✅ All 5 subagents functional when called directly

## What's NOT Working
- ❌ No way to intercept and route Task tool calls
- ❌ Claude Code hooks can't modify tool parameters
- ❌ Subagents never get triggered in normal usage

## The Reality
The subagents system requires deeper integration with Claude Code that isn't possible with the current hook system. The hooks can only:
- Block or allow operations
- Show messages to users
- Cannot dynamically route to different agents

## Workaround Options

### Option 1: Manual Subagent Selection
Users could explicitly specify which subagent to use:
```
Use the context-fetcher subagent to search for TODO comments
```

### Option 2: Wait for Claude Code API Updates
The subagent system is ready but needs Claude Code to support:
- Parameter modification in hooks
- Dynamic agent routing
- Or a plugin system for deeper integration

### Option 3: Create Wrapper Commands
Create specific commands that trigger subagents:
- `/search` - Routes to context-fetcher
- `/test` - Routes to test-runner
- `/git-commit` - Routes to git-workflow

## Conclusion
The subagents are fully implemented and tested but cannot be automatically triggered due to Claude Code's hook limitations. They represent a future capability that will activate when Claude Code's extension system evolves.
