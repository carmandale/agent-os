## Your system for spec-driven agentic development.

[Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os) transforms AI coding agents from confused interns into productive developers. With structured workflows that capture your standards, your stack, and the unique details of your codebase, Agent OS gives your agents the specs they need to ship quality code on the first try‚Äînot the fifth.

### About This Fork

This is an enhanced fork of the original [Agent OS by Builder Methods](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os). We're building on Brian Casel's excellent foundation to add:

- **ü§ñ Specialized Subagents System**: 5 optimized AI agents for common tasks with 25% context reduction and sub-millisecond detection
- **Background Task Management**: Run development tasks (builds, tests, servers) in background without blocking AI workflows
- **GitHub Issues Workflow Enforcement**: Strict requirement for issue-based development with automated tracking
- **Enhanced CLI Tools**: Unified `aos` command with comprehensive project management and task monitoring
- **Tab Indentation**: Preference for tabs over spaces in all generated code
- **Python/React Stack Defaults**: Updated tech stack templates for Python backend (FastAPI/Django) and React frontend development
- **Enhanced Workflow Automation**: Additional hooks and integrations for Claude Code and other AI assistants
- **Improved Error Handling**: More robust workspace hygiene checks and recovery mechanisms

All core Agent OS functionality remains intact, with these enhancements making it even more powerful for professional development teams.

Use it with:

‚úÖ Claude Code, Cursor, or any other AI coding tool.

‚úÖ New products or established codebases.

‚úÖ Big features, small fixes, or anything in between.

‚úÖ Any language or framework.
