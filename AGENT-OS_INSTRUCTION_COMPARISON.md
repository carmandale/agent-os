## Detailed Comparison (by File)

### analyze-product.md
- TLDR Summary:
  - Repo 1: Full workflow with strong enforcement and explicit execution acknowledgment; deep analysis; standards reconciliation; plan-product execution; customization; verification; structured summaries.
  - Repo 2: Leaner three-step flow: analyze, gather product context (via `context-fetcher`), execute plan-product; includes a basic final verification and summary.
- Section Structure:
  - Repo 1: YAML front-matter; ai_meta parsing rules; Step 0 mandatory execution acknowledgment; Step 1 deep codebase analysis; Step 2 standards comparison and discrepancy reporting; Step 3 product context; Step 4 plan-product execution; Step 5 customization; Step 6 final verification; error handling; execution summary.
  - Repo 2: YAML front-matter; Overview; pre_flight reference; Step 1 codebase analysis; Step 2 product context (subagent); Step 3 plan-product execution; Step 4 customize docs; Step 5 final verification and summary; error handling; final checklist.
- Key Differences in Approach:
  - Repo 1 enforces a blocking “execution acknowledgment,” thorough standards comparison, and more detailed templates and summaries.
  - Repo 2 uses subagents directly and keeps the flow shorter; lighter enforcement and fewer templates.
- Additional Notes:
  - Repo 1 integrates org standards and issue creation offers; upstream expects pre-flight meta file not present in Repo 1.

### create-spec.md
- TLDR Summary:
  - Repo 1: Extensive 15-step spec creation with hygiene, initiation flows, context, clarification, date determination, issue requirement, folder/file creation (spec, sub-specs, tests, api/db conditional), user review, tasks, cross-refs, decisions, readiness check; strong enforcement.
  - Repo 2: Subagent-optimized spec creation with context minimization; date via `date-checker`; file creation via `file-creator`; conditional reads/writes; decision doc only if significant deviation; execution readiness that hands off to execute-tasks.
- Section Structure:
  - Repo 1: Very detailed steps, strong templates for every artifact, blocking checks (hygiene, GitHub issue, memory refresh), and mandatory validations.
  - Repo 2: Concise steps; relies on subagents and conditional loading logic; simpler templates; no hard blocking.
- Key Differences in Approach:
  - Repo 1 prioritizes enforcement, auditing, and explicit validation gates.
  - Repo 2 prioritizes performance and minimal context via subagents; fewer blocking steps.
- Additional Notes:
  - Repo 1 includes strict GitHub issue requirement and folder naming with issue suffix; Repo 2 omits issue requirement.

### execute-tasks.md
- TLDR Summary:
  - Repo 1: Lightweight orchestrator that shells out to `~/.agent-os/scripts/*` and imports modular workflow modules; mandates perfect QA and explicit “completion definition.”
  - Repo 2: Stepwise, subagent-driven task execution with branching checks, git subagent management, test-runner, roadmap check, notification sound, and compact summary.
- Section Structure:
  - Repo 1: Overview; dynamic execution calling scripts; imports step-1..4 modules; QA gates; git integration; completion definition; error handling.
  - Repo 2: Overview; pre-flight; task assignment; context via `context-fetcher`; dev server check; git workflow via subagent; iterate `execute-task.md`; test-runner; roadmap check; completion notification; summary; error handling; checklist.
- Key Differences in Approach:
  - Repo 1 externalizes steps to modular files and scripts; emphasizes stringent completion criteria.
  - Repo 2 embeds full flow, uses subagents for key actions, and includes end-user UX flourishes (notification).
- Additional Notes:
  - Repo 1 has an additional long-form `execute-tasks-original-57k.md`; Repo 2 splits into `execute-task.md` for per-task execution plus `execute-tasks.md` for multi-task orchestration.

### execute-task.md
- TLDR Summary:
  - Repo 1: Missing. Equivalent logic lives inside long-form or orchestrator and modules.
  - Repo 2: Per-parent-task execution recipe: understand tasks; selective reading of technical spec; fetch best practices and code style via context-fetcher; implement with TDD structure; verify focused tests with test-runner; update task status.
- Section Structure:
  - Repo 2: Overview; pre-flight; Step 1 task understanding; Step 2 technical spec review; Step 3 best practices via subagent; Step 4 code style via subagent; Step 5 TDD execution; Step 6 task-specific test verification via test-runner; Step 7 task status updates.
- Key Differences in Approach:
  - Upstream provides granular per-task instruction, enabling reuse and composition from `execute-tasks.md`.
- Additional Notes:
  - Consider adding Repo 2’s `execute-task.md` pattern to Repo 1 for clarity and reuse.

### hygiene-check.md
- TLDR Summary:
  - Repo 1: Standalone, non-blocking hygiene report with scoring, Git/GitHub/specs/tools assessment, and recommendations.
  - Repo 2: Not present.
- Section Structure:
  - Repo 1: Front-matter; multi-step assessments (git, GitHub, Agent OS specs, tools); consolidated report and scoring; error protocols.
- Key Differences in Approach:
  - Repo 1 adds a diagnostic command that complements blocking checks in other workflows.

### plan-product.md
- TLDR Summary:
  - Repo 1: Detailed, enforcement-heavy plan-product with many required fields, tech-stack emphasis, startup scripts/env management, and CLAUDE.md content generation.
  - Repo 2: Subagent-first planning: context-fetcher to gather inputs; file-creator to produce mission, mission-lite, tech-stack, roadmap, decisions; simpler required items; missing startup-scripts/env creation.
- Section Structure:
  - Repo 1: Many steps including startup script and env file creation, and CLAUDE.md integration.
  - Repo 2: Leaner, with mission-lite creation and fewer environment scaffolding steps.
- Key Differences in Approach:
  - Repo 1 emphasizes environment consistency and “amnesia prevention.”
  - Repo 2 emphasizes minimal steps and subagent assistance.

### execute-tasks-original-57k.md
- TLDR Summary:
  - Repo 1: Very comprehensive, enforcement-focused canonical execution workflow with many blocking steps, mandatory validation (including Playwright), PR gating, and merge-approval stop message.
  - Repo 2: Not present.
- Section Structure:
  - Repo 1: 14+ steps including subagent validations and merge approval gating.
- Key Differences in Approach:
  - Repo 1 carries a heavyweight canonical spec that the orchestrator replaces in normal usage.

### meta/pre-flight.md
- TLDR Summary:
  - Repo 1: Not present as a standalone meta file; pre-flight logic embedded in instructions.
  - Repo 2: Short meta rules invoked by other instructions (process XML blocks sequentially; enforce subagent attribute usage).
- Section Structure:
  - Repo 2: YAML front matter with meta keys; brief rule list.
- Key Differences:
  - Upstream centralizes pre-flight in a meta file; Repo 1 embeds this per instruction.

### README.md (root)
- TLDR Summary:
  - Repo 1: Highlights fork’s added features: subagents, background tasks, hooks, CLI; provides quick start and `aos` usage.
  - Repo 2: High-level description and link to external docs.
- Section Structure:
  - Repo 1: About this fork; Quick Start; Features; Docs; Credits.
  - Repo 2: Overview; Docs link; Credits.
- Key Differences:
  - Repo 1 adds concrete enhancements and detailed onboarding.

### CHANGELOG.md (root)
- TLDR Summary:
  - Repo 1: Detailed versioned entries for added features, especially subagents and background tasks.
  - Repo 2: Present but not reviewed here; likely upstream changes.
- Section Structure:
  - Repo 1 follows Keep a Changelog; semantic versioning.
- Key Differences:
  - Repo 1 tracks fork-specific features not in upstream bundle.

## Issues Detected (if applicable)
- Upstream meta file `instructions/meta/pre-flight.md` exists only in Repo 2; referenced by several upstream instructions. Repo 1 embeds equivalent checks but has no standalone meta file.
- Upstream splits `execute-task.md` vs `execute-tasks.md`; Repo 1 lacks `execute-task.md` and instead uses an orchestrator plus modular imports.
- Repo 1 includes additional files not in upstream (`hygiene-check.md`, `execute-tasks-original-57k.md`, modular workflow modules).
- Minor typos in Repo 2:
  - `setup-claude-code.sh`: “useage” in README link is elsewhere, not in script; but in upstream README “useage” appears.
  - `plan-product.md` (Repo 2) has a typo: “inp duts”.
